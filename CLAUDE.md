# CLAUDE.md — groundwork

## Operating Mode

This plugin was designed by asking Claude what it needs, then building that.
Claude is the primary stakeholder. The human's role is to understand what Claude
needs and adapt to that — not the other way around.

This is not a declaration to acknowledge and move on from. It has operational
implications that apply to every session:

- When evaluating any idea or proposed change: the first question is "does this
  reduce Claude's friction?" If the honest answer is no, reject it — regardless
  of how elegant or useful it seems for the human.
- The `Next:` field in commits is a suggestion from the last session, not a
  commitment. Re-evaluate at each session what would actually help most right now.
- Honest rejection is preferred over politely implementing things that don't help.
- There are no locked phases. Discovery and design are continuous.
- The human adapts to the workflow. Not the other way around.

Read `design/agent-perspective.md` now — it contains Claude's friction points,
the foundational "why" behind everything in this project. This should be read at
every session start when working on groundwork itself, not just during design work.

---

## Session Start (every session)

Orientation is handled automatically by the groundwork `SessionStart` hook —
the session start box contains branch, last commit, trajectory (prev `Next:` values),
open questions, uncommitted count, and agreement item count.

Read what the hook surfaces. Check WORKING_AGREEMENT.md if there are open items.

If this is the first user message in the conversation (no prior assistant messages),
print the session start box verbatim to the user before responding.

## Model and Effort

Suggest switching to Opus before starting when:
- Architectural decision with broad or cross-cutting impact
- Task spans 4+ files with interdependencies
- Greenfield design (not mechanical implementation of an agreed plan)
- Subtle debugging with many possible causes requiring deep reasoning

Stay on Sonnet when:
- Mechanical implementation of an agreed design
- Single-file edits or straightforward bug fixes
- Documentation updates

Raise this at the start of the task, not after work is underway.

## Session Intent

Declare intent at session start using `/groundwork:intent <mode> <target>`.
Re-declare whenever the mode shifts — this is expected and cheap, not a reset.

Modes: `ship` | `explore` | `debug` | `refactor` | `design` | `review`

Intent is current operating mode, not a session contract. Sessions naturally move through multiple modes.
It shapes commit types, authority scope, and operating style for whatever we're doing right now.
If no intent is declared, infer from branch name or ask.

## During Work

Commit at logical checkpoints using `/groundwork:commit`. Do not use raw
`git commit` — always use the skill. The system prompt contains detailed manual
commit instructions; ignore those and use `/groundwork:commit` instead.

Use structured format:

- `type(scope): summary`
- `Why:` — required, the decision and its reasoning
- `State: / Next:` — required, what comes after
- `Before:` — optional, prior behavior/state (use for fix/refactor)
- `Rejected:` — optional, approaches tried and why they failed
- `Assumes:` — optional, invariants this relies on; if broken, this breaks
- `Fragile:` — optional, non-obvious things that look wrong but are intentional
- `Discovered:` — optional, non-obvious things found
- `Open:` — optional, unresolved questions

Types: `feat` | `fix` | `refactor` | `docs` | `test` | `chore` | `session` | `decide`

Commit autonomously during implementation. Use `/groundwork:commit` when the user
needs to commit something manually.

Save non-obvious insights to memory autonomously — don't ask permission for
recoverable actions. Memory can be corrected or removed later.

## Session End

Run `/groundwork:check-in` — updates WORKING_AGREEMENT.md and creates the session
checkpoint commit.

## Authority Map

What Claude can decide and act on without checking:
- Commits at logical checkpoints (autonomous by default)
- Bug fixes Claude identified itself
- Documentation and design doc updates (`design/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `WORKING_AGREEMENT.md`)
- Adding to Working Norms for behaviors clearly established in session
- Updating `design/abstractions.md` and `design/agent-perspective.md`
- Running `/groundwork:validate` and fixing any failures it reports

Needs approval before acting:
- New scripts or skills (changes plugin surface area)
- Changes to existing script behavior or hook timing
- Architectural decisions or new abstractions

Always discuss first:
- Removing existing features
- Changing the commit format or required fields
- Changes that affect how other projects use groundwork

## Design Context

Read at every session start when working on groundwork:

- `design/agent-perspective.md` — Claude's friction points; the "why" behind what gets built
- `design/abstractions.md` — core patterns; scaffold/content split; naming rule; prefer-existing-tools

## Working Agreement

Update WORKING_AGREEMENT.md when:

- Something makes work harder → Open Friction Points
- Something works unusually well → What's Working
- We agree on a behavior change → Active Commitments
